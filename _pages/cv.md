## Sample GitHub libraries
### Visualisation
[cnv_quant_vis](https://github.com/seafloor/cnv_quant_vis) Not the best-named, but runs fast Bokeh interactive plots for some large data. I had to use parquet files for quick column-wise access and implement the kde and rug plots myself as they were't in Bokeh by default at the time. On the GitHub page there is a follow-through link to the version hosted by Cardiff University so you can run it and see how it works.

[forestplot](https://github.com/seafloor/forestplot) has a better name and a collection of code for static forest plots using matplotlib. Forest plots are almost always done in R, and I didn't want to leave Python, so here it is. This illustrates some of the depth of my matplotlib knowledge as it took a fair (and surprising) amount of customisation to get up and running.

## Education

2016 - 2021: 1+3 PhD in Schizophrenia genetics at Cardiff University.

2011 - 2014: Biochemistry Bsc (Hons). 1st.

I'm not sure anyone wants to hear about my GCSEs and A-levels, so we'll leave it there.
