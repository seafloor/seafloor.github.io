I think the title says the stuff I came here to say. Yay! A lot of hard work, a viva, (minor) corrections and it's finally online and out there.

Well done me! You can find it [here](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/143840/) by the way. I should also say that I mean it's in an online database hosted by Cardiff University. Not that it was published in a journal. Though I am preparing each chapter for publication.

Still, this is good news and now you can enjoy all 60k+ words :)
