# Welcome to Starting Altair!

Confession time - I don't know much about altair. I've used it a few time when I wanted some quick plots, but I've never stuck with it, and I think that's to my detriment. I've looked through a lot of the Python plotting libraries, including many of the standalone ones and the ones with try to mimic plotting other languages like R, and I have to say that Altair is one of the most cohesive, visually appealing and diverse libraries. My only slight hesitancy is that it's based on Vega and Vega-lite, and I'm not sure whether I'll end up dropping down to those when I want fine control? Or maybe, as I think the descriptions of Altair imply, it's designed for quick plots, and I should start with sometime MPL-based if I want to really go through the weeds.

I also have to confess that this is probably the series I'm most excited about! I've been teetering on the edge of getting really into Altair for a while now, and this is finally my chance!

Let's dive in together!
