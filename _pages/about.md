<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/bio-photo.png">Why hello. Welcome to a page on me in a website by me. Here I'm going to talk about me (what else?) but in general I write about anything that interests me. That's naturally going to the things related to biostatistics because of my academic background (see below). Mostly in Python too, because for the syntax is more elegant and intuitive than R, but sometimes I will write about analysis in R too. I still teach the tidyverse in R and use is occasionally, but my go-to choice is Python's SciPy stack. 

I will also write on a range of things I like to learn about in my spare time. The biggest of these is learning languages. Right now my focus is mandarin, which has been a life-long dream for me (particularly attaining good writing proficiency with Chinese characters in order to practice caligraphy), but also Chinese culture and history, the history of relations between the West and East Asia and how this plays into foreign policy, cooking plant-based food and lots more. Occasionally (and hopefully) the stars will align and I will write posts somehow merging these. Cue viral posts on Midjourney-generated vegan brunch ideas. No? More likely things likely plotting and modelling global data on things like health, language use etc.

# My background
I obtained my PhD in psychiatric genetics at Cardiff where I investigated schizophrenia genetics and statistical methods for prediction. I didn't even realise this was a field back when I had just finished my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry; this is also true for most non-biologists who ask about my PhD topic. It seems like a most psychology-based perspective that early-life family environments play the crucial role in later mental health is more widespread (even though the first laws of behavioural genetics have roundly disproved this). Maybe behavioural genetics needs a publicity drive. 

I came across my PhD topic in my previous job. After working in a genomic sequencing centre for a while I got thinking about how many friends and family I knew that struggled with their mental health and about the familial clustering of it all. I picked up Plomin's Behavioural Genetics, read, fell in fascination and applied to a PhD in Cardiff (one of the few universities in the UK which specialise in the area).

# Current role
Now I work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD has a very different genetic landscape from schizophrenia, in addition to being very different phenotypically (I suppose the most they have in common is Kraeplin's name for schizophrenia - dementia praecox) but the principles are still similar in my day-to-day. I spend a lot of time working in what would effectively be called data science in industry - a lot of applied (bio)statistics and machine learning, visualisation, coding, writing etc. My roles have been very much applied, so I work on aspects of these that are specific to genetics, neurology or psychiatry.

Outside of this I spend my time with my family (I'm quite keen on them), baking breads and cakes (I'm also keen on them but it's a bit more one-sided) and learning Mandarin. But I think we've heard enough about me.
