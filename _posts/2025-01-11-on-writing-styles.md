My paragraph way vs sporadic as fuck way. Assert this I don't know what's better, but it's interesting and something I'm always trying to improve on.

Talk about my summary method as the narrative.
Similar to the idea of the red thread in literature.
Like the 3 s idea for paragraphs but find it too prescriptive to follow all the time. Something that's helpful for clarifying a draft though.
