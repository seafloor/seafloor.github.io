# Stand-out GitHub libraries and what they show
## Visualisation
[cnv_quant_vis](https://github.com/seafloor/cnv_quant_vis) won't win any awards for best names, but it's a fast Bokeh interactive plots for some large data. I had to use parquet files for quick column-wise access and implement the kde and rug plots myself as they aren't in Bokeh by default. On the GitHub page there a follow-through link to the version hosted by Cardiff University so you can run it and see how it works.

[forestplot](https://github.com/seafloor/forestplot) has a better name and a collection of code for static forest plots using matplotlib. Forest plots are almost always done in R, and I didn't want to leave Python, so here it is. This illustrates some of the depth of my matplotlib knowledge as it took a fair amount of customisation to get tables up and running around plots.
