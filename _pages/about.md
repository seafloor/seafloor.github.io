Why hello. Welcome to a page about me, written by me, in a website made by me. So let's talk about how to do the most good in society. 

I'm just kidding - let's talk about me and the things I like and stuff. In general I write about anything that interests me. That's naturally going to include things related to biostatistics/data science because of my academic background, but I will also write on a range of things I like to learn about in my spare time. The biggest of these is learning languages. Right now my focus is mandarin, which has been a life-long dream for me (particularly attaining good writing proficiency with Chinese characters in order to practice calligraphy), but topics will include cooking plant-based foods, building habits, general self-improvement and more. Basically learning in general, because it's fun and I like it, so just...okay?

# My background
I guess some people may want to know this depending on what posts they've read. I'm not sure really sure...seems a little out of place in a blog. If you do, I have a PhD in psychiatric genetics from Cardiff where I investigated schizophrenia genetics and statistical methods for prediction. You can check google scholar or something for more information. I know you can read by now so there's no excuses.

# Current role
Now I work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. Again, you can find more elsewhere, so let's keep this moving. Outside of this I spend my time with my family (I'm quite keen on them), baking breads and cakes (I'm also keen on them but it's a bit more one-sided), and learning new things.

The views expressed here are my own. I don't really know what that means. But I do want you to know that it's me that doesn't know, and not someone else, which I suppose means I do know what it means.
