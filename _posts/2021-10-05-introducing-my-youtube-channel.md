# More announcement time!
This blog will chill down a bit soon. It's not going to be announcements like this all the time (right?? tell me it's not?!). It's not. I think that a normal part of starting something is that a lot of exciting things get kicked off the ground.

Maybe kicked off the ground doesn't sound so good. It's a bit negative and destuctive. Launched off the ground? Launched. That sounds good. Like a rocket. A projectile. A meteor. Nope it happened again. Okay, let's just accept this is great. Okay? It IS. And you don't even have to take my word for it. There's [a whole channel and a logo and stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOxMoSP4YqcLXCN4IMxXtnQ) and I'm proud of it, okay?

# What's in a name?
Good question. Well what's in this one is three words - Dots and Squiggles. Why those specific ones? Hard to say. It could be that I've named it after my unfortunately named parents, or that I threw darts at a dictionary and they were the winners, or that that's what I see if I screw my eyes up really tight after looking at a bright light. Or maybe I think it's a funny way of referring to a scatterplot with a flexible curve. Actually I guess it would be curves. Hmmm that sounds fishy. It's probably one of the other ones then.

# What should I do about it?
Go watch it silly :) I mean, when there's something to watch. Which might be now, I don't know when you're reading this, but if not then soon!
