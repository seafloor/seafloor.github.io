I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Cardiff University. I got my PhD in psychiatric genetic, also at Cardiff, looking at schizophrenia and genetics and statistical methods for prediction. I didn't even realise this was a field about when I have finished my undergrad (Biochemistry), then after working in a genomic sequencing centre for a while I got thinking about how many friends and family I knew that struggled with mental health and about the familial clustering of it all. I picked up [Plomin's Behavioural Genetics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Behavioral-Genetics-Robert-Plomin/dp/1429242159/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=behavioural+genetics&qid=1634671930&sr=8-2), read, fell in fasincation and applied to a PhD!

I say I got my PhD - I'm actually still waiting on the award (thank you, COVID) - but the viva is passed! Now I'm working in Alzheimer's genetics. AD has a very different genetic landscape from schizophrenia, in addition to being very different phenotypically (I suppose the most they have in common is Kraeplin's name for schizophrenia - *dementia praecox*) but the principles are still similar in my day-to-day. I spend a lot of time working in what would effectively be called data science in industry - a lot of applied statistics and machine learning, visualisation, coding, writing etc. It's very much applied though, so I work on aspects that are specific to genetics, neurology or psychiatry too.

Outside of this I spend my time with my family (I'm quite keen on them) and baking breads and cakes (I'm also keen on them but I feel like they would have all the healthy effects of a bowl full of vegetables if they really loved me back...). I also blog occasionally on things I like and may or may not be starting to produce more things like videos and code repositories. Present me thinks I will, but it's best to speak to future me that's finished a day of work and having insane children. That guy calls the shots.
