## Sample GitHub libraries
### Visualisation
[cnv_quant_vis](https://github.com/seafloor/cnv_quant_vis) Runs fast Bokeh interactive plots with a large dataset. Uses parquet files for quick column-wise access and generates custom kde and rug plots.

[forestplot](https://github.com/seafloor/forestplot) Static forest plots using matplotlib. Forest plots are almost always done in R, but this is all python. Illustrates some of the depth of my matplotlib knowledge as it took a fair amount of customisation.

Check out [my github](https://github.com/seafloor) for more.

## Education

2016 - 2021: 1+3 PhD in Schizophrenia genetics at Cardiff University.

2011 - 2014: Biochemistry Bsc (Hons). 1st.

I'm not sure anyone wants to hear about my GCSEs and A-levels, so we'll leave it there.
