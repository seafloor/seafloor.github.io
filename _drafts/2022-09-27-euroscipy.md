# An overview of EuroSciPy

I was lucky enough to head to the EuroSciPy conference this year for the first time since 2019 (possibly the first time it was held in-person since then). If you haven't been before, it's split into two parts. First there are tutorials on the fundamentals of the SciPy universe, often with some introductory sessions on SciPy, NumPy, PyTorch, matplotlib etc., and also some on libraries which might be less familiar to you depending on the type of analysis you do, like geopandas. Next there is the conference section, which is more like introducing new packages, major updates or explaining how different types of analyses are done in difference research centres or businesses. The two overlap a bit in that some of the conference talks are essential short tutorials. There's also posters, a lot of coffee, and plenty of time to explore whichever beautiful place in Europe the talks are set outside of conference hours.

This year it was in Basel, Switzerland.
