These are notes I've made on books I've read, inspired by those done by people like Derek Sivers and Ali Abdaal. I'll also pinch the layout from Ali Abdaal's notion template for book summaries. I will be using this, [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) and [readwise](https://readwise.io) to keep track of all my books from 2025 onwards :)
