# Welcome to Starting Distributions!

In this series I'm going to go through distributions with a focus on adding colour and historical context, and practical use cases. When I think about anytime I really remembered more abstract information, it was when I was given more about the lives of the people involved in creating it, so I'll try and do that a little here.

Follow the links below to go through the posts in order, but you can of course skip ahead if the topic is not new to you.
