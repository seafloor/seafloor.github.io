# Teaching the tidy verse

Here are resources for teaching the tidyverse based on my experience teaching MSc bioinformatics students for the last 6+ years. Note that these materials were developed separately by me, so share so structure as expected, but are independent to those I use in-person. The core structure is:

- Overview of R itself and how to get started, find help etc.
- Getting set up with creating reports in Rmarkdown/Quarto; loading data with tibble and readr
- Wrangling data with dplyr, focusing on building up the core 'verbs'
- Manipulating strings and regular expressions
- Handling factors and writing functions

What it doesn't cover, but I would like to in the future
- Dates with lubridate
- Visualisations with ggplot2
- Interactive visualisations with Shiny
